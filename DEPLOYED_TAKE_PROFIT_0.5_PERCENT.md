# ✅ DEPLOYED: Take Profit 0.5%

## Final Configuration

**Take Profit**: 0.5% (was 4%, then 1%, now 0.5%)  
**Stop Loss**: 1% (was 2%, then 1.5%, now 1%)

## Why 0.5%?

In 15-minute Polymarket markets:
- Prices move VERY slowly (typically 0.3% - 1%)
- 4% was impossible to reach
- 1% was still too high
- **0.5% is achievable** and realistic

## Example:

Buy XRP UP @ $0.49:
- 0.5% profit = $0.49245 (just $0.0025 move)
- Bot will sell at $0.49245 or higher
- Much more likely to hit this target

## All Fixes Now Active:

1. ✅ Position persistence (survives restarts)
2. ✅ Skip high-minimum markets (5+ shares)
3. ✅ Take profit 0.5% (realistic target)
4. ✅ Stop loss 1% (tight risk control)

## Next Trade:

Bot will:
1. Buy when opportunity found
2. Sell at just 0.5% profit
3. Take small but frequent profits
4. Build account steadily

Your $6 is ready to trade with realistic profit targets!
