# FIX THE INFINITE LOOP - 3 SIMPLE STEPS

## YOUR PROBLEM
Bot is stuck waiting for bridge (9+ minutes, still checking every 30 seconds).

## THE FIX (3 STEPS - 2 MINUTES TOTAL)

### STEP 1: STOP THE BOT (5 seconds)
In the terminal where the bot is running, press:
```
Ctrl+C
```

This stops the infinite wait loop.

### STEP 2: DEPOSIT VIA POLYMARKET (30 seconds)
1. Open: https://polymarket.com
2. Connect your wallet
3. Click "Deposit"
4. Amount: $3.59 (or any amount)
5. Source: Wallet
6. Network: Ethereum
7. Click "Continue" → Approve
8. Wait 10-30 seconds → Done!

**Why this is better:**
- Takes 30 seconds (not 30 minutes)
- Polymarket pays gas fees (free for you)
- One click

### STEP 3: START BOT (5 seconds)
Run this command:
```bash
python START_BOT_NOW.py
```

Bot will detect your Polymarket balance and start trading immediately!

## THAT'S IT!
Total time: 2 minutes
Your bot will be trading in 2 minutes instead of waiting 20+ more minutes.

## WHAT HAPPENED?
The bridge you initiated is still processing (takes 5-30 minutes).
But you don't need to wait - Polymarket's deposit is instant!

Your bridge will complete eventually, giving you even more funds.
But you can start trading NOW with Polymarket's instant deposit.
