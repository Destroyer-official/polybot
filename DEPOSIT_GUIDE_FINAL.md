## Current Status:

### Your Balances:
- **Private Wallet (Polygon)**: $0.00 USDC
- **Polymarket Balance**: $0.00 USDC
- **Total**: $0.00 USDC

### What Happened to Your $1.05?
The $1.05 you sent went to Polymarket's bridge address (`0x420d22dd3d6f4d1eedc0a6eea364f700d66d8729`). This is being processed by Polymarket's bridge system, but:

**⚠️ Polymarket minimum deposit is $3.00!**

Your $1.05 is below the minimum, so it may:
1. Be returned to your wallet
2. Be held until you add more
3. Need to be withdrawn and re-deposited with $3+
