### What Happened:

The bot used **Polymarket's official Bridge API** to get a deposit address:

```
API Call: POST https://bridge.polymarket.com/deposit
Response: {
  "address": {
    "evm": "0x420d22dd3d6f4d1eedc0a6eea364f700d66d8729",
    "svm": "...",
    "btc": "..."
  }
}
```

### This Address is:
