# DEPOSIT FUNDS NOW - REQUIRED TO START TRADING

## Current Status:
✅ Bot is RUNNING and parsing 77 markets successfully
❌ Bot CANNOT trade - you have $0 in Polymarket
❌ Balance check fails: `('execution reverted', '0x')`

## You Have Available:
- $3.59 USDC on Ethereum mainnet
- $1.05 USDC on Polygon
- 0.000147 ETH for gas

## FASTEST WAY TO DEPOSIT (5 minutes):

### Option 1: Deposit from Ethereum (RECOMMENDED - $3.59 available)
1. Go to: https://polymarket.com
2. Click "Connect Wallet" (top right)
3. Connect your wallet: `0x1A821E4488732156cC9B3580efe3984F9B6C0116`
4. Click your profile → "Deposit"
5. Enter amount: `$3.59` (or less like $3.00 to save gas)
6. Select source: "Ethereum Mainnet"
7. Click "Deposit" - it will bridge automatically
8. Wait 5-10 minutes for bridge to complete

### Option 2: Deposit from Polygon (FASTER - $1.05 available)
1. Go to: https://polymarket.com
2. Click "Connect Wallet" (top right)
3. Connect your wallet: `0x1A821E4488732156cC9B3580efe3984F9B6C0116`
4. Click your profile → "Deposit"
5. Enter amount: `$1.05` (all you have)
6. Select source: "Polygon"
7. Click "Deposit" - instant!

## What Happens After Deposit:
1. Bot will detect your balance automatically (checks every 2 seconds)
2. Bot will start scanning for arbitrage opportunities
3. Bot will execute trades when it finds profitable opportunities (>5% profit)
4. You can watch trades in real-time in the console

## Current Bot Settings:
- Min profit threshold: 5.0% (very conservative)
- Position size: $0.50 - $2.00 per trade (dynamic)
- Scanning: 77 markets every 2 seconds
- Gas limit: 2000 gwei (currently 456 gwei - OK)

## Why Bot Can't Auto-Deposit:
- Polymarket requires you to approve the deposit contract
- This is a security feature - prevents bots from moving your funds
- You must do this manually ONE TIME
- After that, bot can trade autonomously

## DO THIS NOW:
Go to https://polymarket.com and deposit funds!
The bot is ready and waiting for your deposit.
