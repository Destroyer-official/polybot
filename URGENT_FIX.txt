URGENT: YOUR BOT IS STUCK - HERE'S THE FIX
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
Your bot has been waiting 9+ minutes for the bridge and will wait up to 30 minutes.
This is TOO SLOW. You want to trade NOW.

THE FIX (DO THIS NOW):
================================================================================

1. STOP THE BOT
   - Find the terminal window where the bot is running
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop it
   - You'll see "Shutdown requested by user"

2. DEPOSIT VIA POLYMARKET (FASTEST WAY - 30 SECONDS)
   - Go to: https://polymarket.com
   - Connect your wallet (MetaMask)
   - Click "Deposit" button
   - Enter: $3.59 (or any amount you want)
   - Select: Wallet → Ethereum → Continue
   - Approve in MetaMask
   - Wait 10-30 seconds
   - DONE! Money is in Polymarket

3. START BOT AGAIN
   - Run: python START_BOT_NOW.py
   - Bot will see your Polymarket balance
   - Bot will start trading IMMEDIATELY

================================================================================
WHY THIS IS BETTER:
================================================================================
- Bridge: 5-30 minutes (you've waited 9+ already)
- Polymarket deposit: 10-30 seconds
- Polymarket pays gas fees (FREE for you)

================================================================================
WHAT ABOUT THE BRIDGE?
================================================================================
The bridge you started is still processing. It will complete in 5-30 minutes.
When it completes, you'll have even MORE funds to trade with.
But you don't need to wait - start trading NOW with Polymarket deposit!

================================================================================
DO THIS NOW:
================================================================================
1. Ctrl+C (stop bot)
2. Polymarket deposit (30 seconds)

Total time: 2 minutes
You'll be trading in 2 minutes instead of waiting 20+ more minutes!
